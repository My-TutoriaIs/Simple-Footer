# Simple-Footer
Used the section of content at the very bottom of a web page. It typically contains a copyright notice, link to a privacy,  sitemap, logo, contact information, social media icons, and an email sign-up form.

You can then use CSS to style the footer and customize its appearance. The CSS code I have given above will give the footer a dark background color, white text, and a layout with three equal-width columns. You can customize these styles to your liking to create the footer that you want.
